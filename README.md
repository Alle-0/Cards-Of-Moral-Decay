## 💎 THE EXPERIENCE

### 🌑 A Journey into Decadence
A real-time multiplayer card game for those who aren't afraid to laugh at the darkest sides of humanity. No filters, no limits.

### 🌐 Dual Language Support
Fully localized in **English 🇬🇧** and **Italian 🇮🇹**. The interface and the cards adapt to your language, keeping the wit sharp and the humor biting.

### 🤝 Private Lobbies
Created for friends. No random matchmaking, just private rooms where you can be yourself (or your worst version) with people you trust.

### 🎭 Shop & Aesthetics
Collect **Dirty Cash** and redefine your style. Unlock:
- 🌌 **Immersive Themes** (Tokyo, Lucifer, Matrix, Asylum)
- 🎴 **Custom Card Skins**
- 🖼️ **Avatar Frames**

### 🌪️ The Chaos Engine
Entropy is part of the fun. When enabled, the **Chaos Engine** disrupts the game flow every 2 or 3 rounds with 6 different global events.

### 🤖 Rand Bot
Only have one friend? Don't worry, Rando Bot has your back. He automatically joins 2-player games and plays a random card every turn.
